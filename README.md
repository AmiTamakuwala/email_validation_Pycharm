# email_validation_Pycharm

This code is for the e-mail validation where you can check whether your e-mail address is validate or not. 
when we are making our e-mail id there are many conditions to make e-mail id such as no capital letter, only 1 special character, any numeric numbers, only one @ sign etc. 

so our e-mail id is valid or not we can search by using coding....

I applied many condition in this code and all specification in the comment. so it makes easy to un=derstand the code. and by runing the code it will give the result whether your id is correct or not. and if it's not it will also give the result why it is not correct which condition you missed to amke your e-mail id. 

* The code serves as a basic email validation tool, but keep in mind that email validation can be more complex in real-world applications, as it may involve additional checks, such as DNS lookups to verify the domain or checking if the email actually exists.
* This code is a starting point and may need further customization and validation checks depending on your specific use case.
